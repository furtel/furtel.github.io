            <h2>Follow this Hello World exercise to get started with GitHub.</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
                It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
                This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, 
                branches, commits, and pull requests. 
                You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's 
                pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
                In this quickstart guide, you will:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create and use a repository</li>
                    <li>Start and manage a new branch</li>
                    <li>Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits</li>
                    <li>Open and merge a pull request</li>
                </ul>
                To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub account and Internet access. 
                You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, 
                or install Git (the version control software that GitHub is built on).
